        "To begin with, you must press the menu icon on the top"
        "left of the screen. Afterwards, you need to press the"
        "'Add Clothes' Button that will lead you to a different"
        "menu where you can take a picture of your piece of"
        "clothing, as well as add a few details about it such as"
        "color, category and style. After you are done, all you"
        "need to do is click the 'Add' button that will save your"
        "picture alongside the matching information for you to be"
        "able to view it later or use it in your current outfit.\n\n"

        "How to view the items you've already stored?\n\n"

        "Just as before, as an option of the same menu you have"
        "the 'My clothes' button which, after clicking, will send"
        "you to another screen where you can see all of your"
        "items organised into a list that contains not only the"
        "pictures of your clothes, but also all the specified"
        "details.\n\n"

        "How do you build your outfit for the day?\n\n"

        "After pressing the 'Build outfit' button on the main screen, you will be sent to another screen"
        "that allows you to select up to seven pieces of clothing for the day, from hats and accessories,"
        "to dresses and shoes, depending on the style you are going for.\n\n"

        "Problems and further updates\n\n"

        "Even though a lot of work has been invested into this project, it is far from over."
        "In the following versions of the application, we intend to make the 'plus' button on"
        "the main screen usable (since in this version it does not lead anywhere), as well as"
        "give our users the option to build their outfit based on the temperature outside."
        "When you add a new piece of clothing to your collection you are required to specify"
        "the temperature interval when you can wear it. This option is, for now, virtually useless since"
        "it does not help you anyhow when building your outfit. We plan to fix this in the near future.\n\n"
